## Content

This repository contains :
- a *Jupyter Notebook* which is the conclusion of the ***Data Cleaning Project Walkthrough*** from [dataquest.io](dataquest.io). It is a guided project whose aim is to use all the techniques and skills learnt during the course. Nevertheless we are dealing with real-word data: in our case data about New York City public schools and more especially their SAT Score.
- different .txt and csv files that are used in the notebook.
